* **Entry Fee**: $10 donation. All proceeds go to [Mission 22](https://www.mission22.com/), an
  organization that works to prevent veteran suicide.
* **Structure**: 50-minute Swiss+1 rounds based on attendance.
* **Payout**: This is a charity event, so there will not be a payout of the entry fees. We're
  hoping to include a few prizes, but this event is about having fun for a good cause.
* **Proxy limit**: This event is **NON-PROXY**.
* **Ruleset**: We will be using Eternal Central's deck construction rules, found
  [here](http://www.eternalcentral.com/9394rules/). Again, this event is **NON-PROXY**.

  Please send an image to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com, with your name in the
  subject line.
