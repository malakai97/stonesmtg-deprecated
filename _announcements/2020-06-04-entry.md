Welcome to our Summer 2020 Middle School League!

*	**Format:** Middle School, using Eternal Central’s deck construction and
  play rules (i.e. mana burn, damage on the stack, etc)
*	**Location:** Webcams! Players can use GChat, Zoom, Discord, or whatever
  service they like to play their matches. If you have questions about playing
  paper Magic over webcams, please contact Stu for basic tips, or do some
  Googling.
*	**Proxy Limit:** 100% proxy. Please make your proxies clear so opponents
  can easily identify them over webcam.
*	**Entry:** RSVP to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com. We also encourage an
  optional $10 donation to Central Texas Food Bank.
*	**Decklists:** Send written decklists to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com.
  We welcome deck pictures, too.
*	**Structure:** Swiss rounds, with a cut to Top 4. Players will have 1 week
  to coordinate and play each match.
*	**1st Place Prize:** Survival of the Fittest playmat
*	**Coolest Deck Prize:** Mox Diamond playmat

We’ll be taking signups until June 14th, and Round 1 will begin June 15th.
