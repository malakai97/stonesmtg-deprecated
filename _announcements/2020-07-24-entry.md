  play rules (i.e. mana burn, damage on the stack, etc)
* **Prizes:** $100 Pat's Games (patsgames.com) total prizes.
*	**Location:** Webcams! Players can use GChat, Zoom, Discord, Whereby, or whatever
  service they like to play their matches. If you have questions about playing
  paper Magic over webcams, please contact Stu for basic tips, or do some
  Googling.

  the Central Texas Food Bank, based on the honor system. (Don't worry about it
  if you can't afford $5 because the world is crumbling around us.)
