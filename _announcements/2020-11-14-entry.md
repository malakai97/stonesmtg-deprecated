We miss Vintage. It’s still plagueing outside, though, so let’s play from
the comfort of our own homes! Grab yourself a six-pack or a bottle of wine, and
cozy up for a day of Magic with your buds.

**Registration Deadline:** Wednesday, November 11th. To register, email your
written decklist and Discord handle to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com. We have
a custom proxy participation card for all players; if you’d like to receive
one, please include your physical mailing address in your registration email.

**Location:** This event will be run through the
[Romancing The Stones Discord](https://discord.gg/5YE8DED5wD).
Pairings and announcements will be posted in the RtS19 channel.

**Entry Free:** $0! No cash prizes, but 1st Place wins an awesome proxy custom
card, and a spot in the 2020/2021 Invitational Championship.

**Proxy Limit:** Unlimited proxy.

**Proxy Rules:** As always, this event is 100% proxy. However, it’s important
that your opponent can easily recognize your proxies over a webcam. Please,
make your proxies full size, full color, etc. If you are unsure about the
quality of your proxies, run them by Stu.

**Here’s How It Works:** RtS19 will run over the course of Saturday, November
14th. The Player Meeting will kick off at 11:00 CST in the RtS Discord Voice
Channel.

Each round, you and your opponent may use whatever webcam app you prefer to
play your match.

We’ll be playing 50-minute rounds. You and your opponent will be responsible
for the clock; when you begin your match, begin a 50-minute timer. Yes, we
anticipate rounds and the overall event will run pretty long. Settle in for a
nice, full day of Vintage.

When you’re done with your match, post your results in the RtS19 Results
channel. Then come hang out! We encourage players to grab a drink and chat in
the Discord voice channel.

In the interest of keeping things running smoothly and on-time, we will have a
1-Strike-And-You’re-Out policy for missing your round. If you do not show up
and play your match in time, we will give your opponent a win and drop you from
the tournament. To that end, if you’re experiencing issues during the day and
think you’re going to have trouble, please contact Stu immediately so he can
help you out!

This event is capped at 32 players (the maximum for 5 rounds of Swiss). After
Swiss, we will cut to Top 8. The intention is to then stream Top 8 on Twitch.
