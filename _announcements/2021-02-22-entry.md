Welcome to our Spring 2021 Middle School League!

*	**Format:** Middle School, using Eternal Central’s deck construction and
  play rules (i.e. mana burn, damage on the stack, etc)
*	**Location:** Webcams! Players can use GChat, Zoom, Discord, Whereby, or whatever
  service they like to play their matches. If you have questions about playing
  paper Magic over webcams, please contact Stu for basic tips, or do some
  Googling. Romancing the Stones manages a [Discord](https://discord.gg/SNCrZT)
  server. Check there for more info on where the easiest places to play are.
*	**Proxy Limit:** 100% proxy. Please make your proxies clear so opponents
  can easily identify them over webcam.
*	**Entry:** RSVP to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com. Entry is a $5 donation to
  the Central Texas Food Bank, based on the honor system. (Don't worry about it
  if you can't afford $5 because the world is crumbling around us.)
*	**Decklists:** Send **deck photos** to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com prior to
  your first match. It's okay to just send a list if you haven't gotten your cards
  together yet; just note that we'll need an image before the end of the tournament.
*	**Structure:** Swiss rounds, with a cut to Top 8. Players will have 1 week
  to coordinate and play each match.

We’ll be taking signups until February 19th, and Round 1 will begin February 22nd.
