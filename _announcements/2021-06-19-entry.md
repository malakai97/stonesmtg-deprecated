We're back, baby! RTS21 is happening IN PERSON!

*	**Format:** Vintage (Modern Horizons 2 is legal)
*	**Location:** Kinda Tropical, 3501 E 7th St, Austin, TX 78702. We'll be in the
  indoors section.
* **Date & Time:** Saturday, June 19th at 12:00 CST
*	**Entry:** $10. Cash only.
* **Prizes:** 100% of entry fees paid out to top 4. 1st place will also win a unique RTS
  trophy card, and a spot at the 2020/2021 Invitational.
* **Registration:** There is no RVSP for this event; just show up. Make sure you bring a
  deck and a decklist. We will have a few loaner decks and blank decklists available,
  but it's much easier to prepare ahead of time.
*	**Proxy Limit:** 100% proxy. Please make your proxies clear so opponents
  can easily identify them.
* **Structure:** X rounds of Swiss (usually 4-5), followed by a cut to top 4.
