School’s Out Forever! Or at least till our next league.

*	**Format:** Middle School, using Eternal Central’s deck construction and
  play rules (i.e. mana burn, damage on the stack, etc)
*	**Location:** Webcams! Players can use GChat, Zoom, Discord, Whereby, or whatever
  service they like to play their matches. If you have questions about playing
  paper Magic over webcams, please contact Stu for basic tips, or do some
  Googling. Romancing the Stones manages a [Discord](https://discord.gg/9T8tqdFuJV)
  server. Check there for more info on where the easiest places to play are.
*	**Proxy Limit:** 100% proxy. Please make your proxies clear so opponents
  can easily identify them over webcam. One card that is just sharpie'd on is fine, but
  60 of them is a psychic assault.
*	**Entry:** RSVP to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com.
*	**Decklists:** Send **deck photos** to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com prior to
  your first match. It's okay to just send a list if you haven't gotten your cards
  together yet; just note that we'll need an image before the end of the tournament.
*	**Structure:** Swiss rounds, with a cut to Top 8. Every Monday you will get paired
  with an opponent, and you will have the week to coordinate and play your match.
* **Prize:** Top 8 gets RTS-stamped cards (TBD); winner receives an invite to our annual
  [Invitational Tournament](/invitational) in Austin, where the season's champion will
  be crowned.

Signups close on Friday, June 23rd. Round 1 will begin Monday, June 26th!
