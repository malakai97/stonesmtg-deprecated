The pandemic has had a profound impact on all paper Magic communities.
Romancing The Stones is no exception to that. We want to stay engaged during
this time, and have been exploring digital events and activities to bring us
together.

At the end of June, we asked our players to design cards that would be good
additions to the Vintage card pool. We suggested this could mean a number of
things: a competitive option for a tier 1 deck; something cool to brew around;
something that just seems fun in a format with Black Lotus; a card that boosts
a flagging archetype; a great sideboard roleplayer; or something that fixes a
problem in the format. The entries ran the gamut of those, and gave us a lot to
chew on!

RtS oldtimers Stu and Ben judged the competition, and want to sincerely thank
every one of our contestants for taking the time and energy to design cards for
us! Every single card was interesting, funny, or both or us to talk about. We
would be privileged to get to play with the cards y’all came up with.

We judged submissions for the following 4 categories:
-	Best Overall Design
-	Most Flavorful
-	Most Likely to Get Restricted
-	The Lurrus Award for Worst Design
The submissions were so well done that for most of those categories, we had to
award both a 1st Place and a Runner-up.

Eric Vergo took home Best Overall with his excellent Precarious Connection. Our
card-design guru Bobby will be drafting up and printing a unique copy of
Precarious Connection for Eric’s collection.

(We really appreciated submissions that were done in a frame, with art. For
those that weren’t, we’ve done them here with our Burger logo.)
