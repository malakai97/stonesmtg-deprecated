_by Woodrow Bogucki_

I just finished a Middle School league run by local old school magic group
Romancing the Stones. The format runs from Ice Age + 4th Edition through
Scourge + 7th Edition. The exact banned restricted list can be found
[here](https://www.eternalcentral.com/middleschoolrules/). It is a bit strange.
This report will cover my observations on the format and some notable
decks / matches that were in the tournament.

## The Format

###	The mana is very limiting

You have allied fetchlands (but no duals to fetch), all ten painlands, and
then...gotta stretch. If you’re playing
a short game, City of Brass and Gemstone Mine exist. Mox Diamond is one of the
most powerful cards in the format for both mana fixing and acceleration, and
it’s not unreasonable to run it in fair three color decks. These mana
constraints force the format towards two color decks.

###	The threats are not very threatening

In modern Magic if your
opponent has some creature (or, heaven forbid, planeswalkers), attack twice and
you’re probably dead. Examples would be Dreadhorde Arcanist, Monastery
Mentor, or the odious Uro. All modern creature generate unreal value that is
very hard to recover from. Card design was very different 15 years ago. You can
freely let your opponent’s 5 drop (Spiritmonger) swing twice and still
recover to win the game. For instance, mono red has Jackal Pup instead of
Goblin Guide - a HUGE downgrade. This was kind of cool in that it allowed you
to take a turn off setting up or drawing cards (like Fact Or Fiction or Necro)
and not be too far behind.

###	The combo danger is real.

During testing it was discovered combo
decks could consistently execute on turn three. There’s a lot of fast mana
and tutors in this format due to the inexplicable banned list. Before the
league some players were mentioning not having to pay the “Force of Will
Tax”. I wonder if they will do so next league?

### The spells are very good.

While the aggro threats were underwhelming,
the spells were great! Counterspell/Force of Will and Swords to Plowshares are
incredibly efficient. Oath of Druids also exists to put the boots to aggro.
Even mono red got an upgrade with Fireblast. It was also noted the sideboard
cards could be unbeatable (e..g Null Rod against Tinker, or CoP Red against
Sligh). If your sideboard was correct you could get some free wins.
From these points it was determined that a two color interactive deck or a
combo deck (or make the big brain deck plays like Hayden and play a two color
interactive deck with a combo!) would be best. Aggro would be represented, but
would underperform. If you could tutor up your sideboard hosers with any of
these tutors in the format, that would be useful.

## Top Decks, Deconstructed

### Honorable Mention: Tinker, by Andrew Webb

This deck defined combo danger for the tournament. Several of his matches were
very lopsided turn 3 wins. After watching the turn three win, Eric Vergo on GR
Fires admitted some concerns about his deck choice. It’s distinctly possible
if Webb hadn’t forgotten how Defense Grid worked in round three we’d be
having a different discussion about top 8 lists. It’s also worth noting
Tinker lost to a single Force of Will in game 1 of round five and finally hit
its fail case in game 2 and did nothing. The deck still has room to be further
refined. Do not ignore this danger.

### Enchantress, by David London

David ran into some difficult matches in the swiss playing against two decks
with Meddling Mage, and his worst possible matchup in the quarters, playing
against Pernicious Deed and Diabolic Edict. Honestly, though, Enchantress has a
good plan. Most decks cannot remove a bunch of enchantments or a shroud
creature. When the engine is online, it generates mana and draws cards and can
win any number of ways. Bouncing all your permanents with Words of Wind,
decking you with Stroke of Genius, or Earthcraft + Squirrel Nest for infinite
tokens.
Once again this architype can be further refined. The white splash can go
deeper for more Replenish, Solitary Confinement, or Sterling Grove. How many
Earthcraft / Squirrel Nest is correct? This is a slower combo deck so it needs
to have stuff in the board to beat faster combos. David has Mana Leaks and some
enchantment hosers. Neat deck.
### Survival, by Bryan Hockey and Lorien Elleman

Hockey’s deck really demonstrates the difficulty with the mana in the format.
By his own admission it was a bit of a hot mess. He has Survival and the tutor
package from Academy Rector to go get it or the Enduring Renewal combo, but he
had too many moving pieces and ways to avoid losing the game (Walls, Spore Frog
lock, Worship) and not really very good at winning the game.
Lorien is a bit more focused and is probably the stronger build without
Survival in play. The white splash is very light, so the three colors aren’t
stretched too hard. I like having access to the unfair turn three Akroma nut
draw as well. This deck isn’t the best at filling up its graveyard so I’m
unsure how good Circular Logic is, and the blue card count is low for Force of
Will. Also, if you’re a creature deck with blue and splashing white. . . How
about some Meddling Mages in the 75??
Survival is very powerful. There’s a high correlation between having it in
play for two turns and winning the game. Lorien’s build is very close to
optimal for a “fair” Survival build. The degenerate build is still out
there and most likely involves Volrath’s Shapeshifter or maybe Academy Rector
for Pattern of Rebirth.

### UW Landstill, by Woodrow Bogucki and Patrick Vincent

WHAT GREAT DECKS. In my unbiased opinion these decks are clearly the best.
In all seriousness at first I thought the deck would be a little too slow to
win and very mopey. After a few matches I was more and more impressed. The
spells are so efficient and my sideboard (mainly Meddling Mage) overperformed
every time. The end game lock out of Humility helped beat creature decks with
lots of card advantage (like Survival, Elves, or Goblins) and even had utility
against combo like Stiflenaught or Reanimator. Our lists are not very
different, with the big difference being the sideboards. After this tourney I
think four sideboard Meddling will be stock for every manabase that can support
them.
This deck is clearly tier 1. However, there isn’t much room for improvement.
Our lists were so similar because the inclusions were so straightforward. The
best removal, the best countermagic, the best card draw (well, second best -
curse you, Necro!). When you play against this deck there won’t be many
surprises and it’s possible the rest of the format may catch up to it.

### Elves! by Travis Brown*

At first glance I had some concerns about this deck not respecting the combo
danger, and I though the Biorhythm was a win-more inclusion. I understand
it’s creating reach for our green deck, but come on - eight mana??? I still
have some concerns about getting turn three killed, but if this deck is on the
play, it can execute its “combo” of casting Armageddon or Plow Under on
turn three. Most combo decks can’t beat that. A lot of sweet synergies are
available and card advantage from Sylvan Messenger. Two matches got out right
stolen by Caller of the Claw. The fast mana available is very powerful with
some form of the Trinity Green shell being worth exploring further. Deranged
Hermit is one of the best threats in the format. Travis mentioned losing a game
to the card Hibernation. There’s not any way to modify the deck to avoid that
though. Also, Engineered Plague was very painful.

### UW Stiflenaught, by Hayden Bagot

![](/assets/images/2020-07-24/haydenstiflenaught.jpg)

Hayden went 5 – 0 in the swiss and this deck was the talk of the tournament.
It is doing the best of both worlds an interactive two color deck with a
proactive powerful combo. The cards are very well thought out with Mother of
Runes and Meddling Mage protecting the combo from Swords to Plowshares, and
just in general wrecking people’s game plans.
Further inspection reveals some weaknesses to this specific build. It’s very
all in on the combo, with 16 pieces (or tutors), and as the games go long it
doesn’t have a way to recuperate if it gets 2-for-1’d. Andrew Webb made his
deck in a similar all in fashion, which in the dark is fine. When in doubt, be
as degenerate as possible. I’d like to see some way to vector off of the
combo as much in sideboard games when people will have more Disenchant effects
and Meddling will be less reliable (do I name Disenchant or Seal of Cleansing?)
Time will tell if that deckbuilding holds up. The combo can take as little as 8
or as many as 16 cards in the deck. And the rest is UW spells which have proven
themselves to have the tools to get the job done. A powerful game plan with
room to grow if you expect the right metagame.

### The Rock, by Rob Connolly

![](/assets/images/2020-07-24/robrock.jpg)

Doing “the people’s work,” Rob rocked the tournament with the classic
combination of black disruption and green fat.
This deck was difficult to evaluate at first. Its contents were so
schizophrenic: Recurring Nightmare was unexciting, the mana on Necro is
ambitious, giving your opponent lands with Veteran Explorer, and Spiritmonger
is a joke. After a few games I realized it was the “ham sandwich”
deckbuilding plan. If the list starts with 4 Cabal Therapy, 4 Pernicious Deed,
and 4 (or 3?) Cecropotence, the rest of the list doesn’t really matter. These
cards are so powerful that the floor on the deck is going to be quite high.
(Hymn isn’t too bad, either)
There are some finer nitpicks to be made. Deranged Hermit is great,
Spiritmonger is not, so maybe switch up those numbers. The sideboard not
including Genesis was a glaring oversight. I felt UW Landstill was very
marginally favored against this list, but if he had a Genesis Wish target, I
would have some large concerns. Choke isn’t very effective due to the way
mana works in this format, and some more GY hate than just Withered Wretch
would be prudent.
Oh wait!? It doesn’t matter! This is like debating making a ham sandwich with
rye or whole grain bread (rye, obviously). It’s still going to be delicious.
And now we do smell what The Rock is cooking. HAM SANDWICH!

## Moving Forward

The finals featured two interactive two color decks in a close matchup. Will we
see a format where combo continues to invalidate aggro? Part of my lack of
faith in aggro is because unlike other decks, they don’t have as much room
for improvement in deck building. So for them to compete, it seems to me they
need to radically shift and incorporate more disruptive elements. Leaving us
with only combo and disruptive decks? What archetypes remain unexplored (many),
and as a result will the colors blue and black assert dominance over the
format? I know a lot of players don’t want to be in another “blue good
stuff” format, so here’s your chance to step up.
