# Background

In 1994, Wizards of the Coast partnered with Heartbreaker Miniatures to produce
a line of pewter miniatures based off Magic card art. The first 36 were drawn
from Alpha, while the second 12 came from The Dark. Shortly after, the line
faded into obscurity without making much impact on the collective consciousness
of Magic players.

Four years later I was in 5th grade. That year I not only bought my very first
Magic cards, but also my first Warhammer miniatures. Both of these hobbies have
stuck with me these 25 years since, albeit waxing and waning: while in college
and my early twenties I took a break from Magic and painted hundreds of
miniatures, since 2014 I’ve been playing lots of Magic and painting less.

Recently, though, these two hobbies have come to intersect in a funny way. A
few years ago I stumbled across the Heartbreaker Miniatures line. Amused and
intrigued, I bought a Prodigal Sorceror to paint as a prize donation for The
Battle Of San Antonio Old School tournament. It was a fun project, and since
then I’ve painted a handful more as gifts and prizes.

**Painting The Minis**

Much as Magic card art has changed enormously since 1994, miniatures have also
gotten much more sophisticated. Contemporary miniatures are an engineering
marvel: hand-sculpting has largely given way to computer-generated designs that
can make for incredibly crisp, detailed, dynamic miniatures.

Personally, that doesn’t do anything for me, and I don’t really buy new
miniatures. Miniatures from the 80s and 90s, on the other hand, are very much
human artisanal pieces. There’s a soul to them, and you can sense that they
were made by a person. That is *certainly* true of the Heartbreaker MtG line.
As you’ll see, these sculpts range from simple to downright primitive, often
comically so.

An interesting component to the miniatures is the extension and extrapolation
of art. For many of these, the original card art is limited to a profile or
portrait from the neck up (e.g. Lord of the Pit, Prodigal Sorceror, Natural
Selection). The sculptors had to extend that to create entire bodies,
equipment, and poses. In some instances this is pretty seamless and artfully
done; in others, you get some strange choices and questionable overall
composition.

I’ve shared some of these before, but as there’s so little out there about
this corner of MTG collecting, I thought I’d put them all in one place.

*Prodigal Sorceror*

I think Tim’s one of the better sculpts in the range. Unlike some other
minis, his face is pretty close to the art and isn’t too simian. Likewise,
they did a good job extending him from a portrait into a full body, and he’s
got lots of cool details: a belt full of magic vials and books (you may notice
I painted the spellbook with a Magic card back!), the glass orb, and fun
pointed shoes.

I’m largely happy with the paintjob. I regret only giving his robe a single
stripe of gold, rather than the two he has on the card art, but otherwise
he’s solid. The base was inspired by
[a great mini by my favorite painter, Jakob Rune
Nielsen]({{site.cdn_url}}/assets/images/2023-08-18/jrn.jpg).

*Natural Selection*

My good friend Patrick bought this and asked me to paint it for him. This was a
fun, colorful mini to work on with some amusing components. I like the
sculptor’s decision to put him in a kilt; it worked out well re. composition,
as the red offsets the yellow and black pretty well. Less endearingly, the
sculptor made the curious decision to sculpt physically-raised tiger stripes,
which would have otherwise been very easily to just *paint on there myself.*

*Lord of the Pit*

[As part of the Festival of Friendship
2021](https://stonesmtg.com/results/2021-01-20/), we ran a charity auction to
raise money for the Central Texas Food Bank. Brian Tweedy generously donated a
Beta Lord of the Pit, I painted this guy to go with it, and RTS-staple Kai
Schafroth bought the pair.

Unlike the others I’ve painted, I departed pretty far from Tedin’s art on
this one: while I *love* Lord of the Pit, painting him as just a big fleshy guy
seemed pretty boring. Instead, I wanted him to look like he was somewhere very
dark, and the only light was coming from lava below him and his eyes. It’s
not perfect, but it’s an interesting take, anyway.

This is another great example of the sculptor having to invent a full body for
the card art. Interestingly, they chose to give him a big, demonic sword. It
makes sense, though I never really imagined Lord of the Pit needing weapons
other than his claws.

*Holy Armor*

Holy Armor’s one of the more amusing inclusions in the Heartbreaker line. Who
likes this card, and who wants a mini of it? Apparently me.

I painted this up as a donation to [last year’s Hurricane Weekend charity
raffle]( https://stonesmtg.com/results/2022-09-17/). Pretty quick paintjob, as
it’s mostly just metal. I don’t remember who won this in the raffle, but I
hope whoever it is is enjoying a large boost to their toughness.

*Mahamoti Djinn*

I’d been excited to paint a Mahamoti ever since I saw he was part of the
line. In a lot of ways, he’s exactly what I’m drawn to in a miniature:
he’s very simple, with only a handful of colors to focus on (flesh, green,
smoke, gold, and the base). Unfortunately, I think the sculpt suffers from a
pretty amateurish face: Mahamoti’s art has this wonderful bemused expression,
but this guy looks like a less-mutated Toxic Avenger.

I painted him up as my contribution to the potlach prize pool at the Team
Serious Invitational: The Land 4. I included with him a 9.5 graded 4th Edition
Mahamoti, because I find it funny that anyone got one graded in the first place.

*Uncle Istvan*
![]({{site.cdn_url}}/assets/images/2023-08-18/uncle.jpg)

If “Summon Uncle Istvan” isn’t wonderful to you, I don’t know what to
say. I painted up this mini for our upcoming Hurricane Weekend, where he’ll
be raffled off along with a graded Uncle Istvan.

As much as I love the card, the mini was probably the least fun to work on of
these 6. He’s a lot of brown, but more importantly, the face is truly poorly
done: whereas the art is fairly menacing, this guy looks like a goofus. That
said, I had some fun with the blood effects on the axe, and I thought the dead
grass & slushy snow motif on the base fit well with the dark, Eastern European
horror vibes the card gives off.

**My Thoughts**

Old School isn’t exactly *nostalgic* for me: I got into Magic in 1998, so the
cards I’m actually attached to come from later sets. That said, I find the
oldest Magic cards amusing and charming. They’re goofy, and they’re
evocative of an era *just* before my time. The 80s and early 90s were the
precursors of the nerd- and pop-culture I was into; I appreciated that then,
just as I appreciate it now.

I feel similarly about these miniatures: they’re a cool curiosity that’s
evocative of a period when nerd culture was still nascent and largely
underground. The minis themselves aren’t refined, nor is the concept behind
them.

The cards they chose to make into miniatures is pretty arbitrary. You get
enduring pieces like Dark Ritual, Hurloon Minotaur, and Lord of Atlantis –
cards that resonate with lots of players or have special significance in the
history of Magic marketing. But then there’s also choices like Wormwood
Treefolk, Thicket Basilisk, Scavenging Ghoul, and Nettling Imp. Why do we get
Guardian Angel, but not Serra Angel? Ley Druid, but not Llanowar Elves?

Well, this was new territory for Wizards. While by 1994 Magic was certainly a
success, the game was still young enough that perhaps they didn’t know what
exactly was iconic and beloved. And for that matter, I’m not privy to how the
arrangement between Wizards and Heartbreaker played out: did Wizards choose
which cards should get the 3D treatment, or did Heartbreaker and its sculptors
pick whichever they thought would make the coolest miniatures?

In 2023, Wizards and its playerbase are much, much more familiar with
licensing. In the past few years we’ve seen a planned Netflix show, a
clothing collaboration with Brain Dead, branded Cheez Its, celebrity
endorsements via Post Malone, and of course the runaway success of their
Universes Beyond cards. Wizards is now part of a Fortune 500 company, and as
with so much other media and entertainment, everything nowadays is about
activating IP as fully as possible.

Personally, as the quantity of printings has gone up and the internet’s made
access to cards instantaneous and universal, my relationship with collecting
side of this hobby has changed. What is the point of collectibles when anyone
can have any card they want, any time? How do we judge aesthetic value and
desirability when there are often a half-dozen or more variant frames and arts
more any given new card? For me, one option to combat that is diving further
into the obscure corners of our hobby. The Heartbreaker Miniatures are that:
they’re the esoterica of any already esoteric game, and tracking them down
and painting them is a fun, absurdist exercise.

And so I’ll be out there, painting these strange little pewter pieces and
keeping my eye out for more of them! Dark Ritual, Black Knight, and Lord of
Atlantis, I’ve got you in my sights.
