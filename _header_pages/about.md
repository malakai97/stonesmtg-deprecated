Romancing the Stones is two things:

Romancing the Stones is a proxy vintage series in Austin, TX, that consists of eight (8)
tournaments, with the winners progressing to the Romancing the Stones invitational at the end
of the year.

Romancing the Stones is a community of vintage, old school, legacy, and other Magic players
in Austin, TX, who are fans of eternal formats.  We're a growing community of casual to
competitive players who like to have a good time, jam some games, and have a beer or two.
(Having a beer is optional).
