becomes the Romancing the Stones Season Champion, and earns a year of bragging rights.

# Invites

Invites to the players who will qualify for the season 5 / 2023 Invitational
are given out for:

* 1 invite to last season's invitational champion
* Winning a single-day or league event (other than the Festival of Friendship)

Players can never earn more than one invitation. Thus, if a player who is already
invited places 1st at an event, the invitation for that event would go to the 2nd place
finisher. If that player is also already invited, 3rd and 4th place will face off for
the invite.
