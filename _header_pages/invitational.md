Romancing the Stones tournament series are divided into seasons. Each season lasts about
a year, and ends with the Romancing the Stones Invitational for that season. The winner
becomes the Romancing the Stones Season Champion, and earns a year of bragging rights.

# Event Info for the Season 4 Invitational

* Date: Early December
* Location: Austin
* Format: Likely a split of Vintage and Middle School with open decklists.

# Invites

Invites to the players who will qualify for the season 3 / 2020-2021 Invitational
are given out for:

* 1 invite to last season's invitational champion
* Winning a single-day or league event (other than the Festival of Friendship)

Players can never earn more than one invitation. Thus, if a player who is already
invited places 1st at an event, the invitation for that event would go to the 2nd place
finisher. If that player is also already invited, 3rd and 4th place will face off for
the invite.
