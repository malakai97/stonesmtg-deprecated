Romancing the Stones tournament series are divided into seasons. Each season lasts about
a year, and ends with the Romancing the Stones Invitational for that season. The winner
becomes the Romancing the Stones Season Champion, and earns a year of bragging rights.

# Info

The 2021 Romancing the Stones Invitational will be held Saturday, December 4th. It will
be here in Austin, at our very own Brian Tweedy's new club. There will be food and
beverages provided on-site. In the past, we've overlapped with the bar opening, so do
bring your wallet.

The time isn't set in stone yet, but tentatively we are aiming for a kickoff between
10 and 12 CST.

We will have 12 players this Invitational, so we'll be playing 4 rounds of Swiss.
Rounds 1 & 2 will be Vintage, and rounds 3 & 4 will be Middle School.
After that we'll cut to top 4, which will be Vintage. Make sure you have decks for
both formats! And yes, it's 100% proxy.

We will be playing with open decklists. Before the event, Stu will ask everyone to
submit their lists by 11:59pm Thursday, December 2nd. On Friday, December 3rd, we will
will share them with everyone here and in discord so that you can study up on your
opponents.

We want to accommodate our non-Texan players. As such, if you can't be in Austin for the
tournament, we will have laptops set up so you can play your matches via webcam! If you're
gonna be out of town, please confirm with us ASAP that you can be available all day on
December 4th.

We'll have cool prizes, which will be revealed closer to the event.

More details to come!

# Invites

Invites to the 12 players who will qualify for the season 3 / 2020-2021 Invitational
are given out for:

* 1 invite to last season's invitational champion
* Winning a single-day or league event (other than the Festival of Friendship)

Players can never earn more than one invitation. Thus, if a player who is already
invited places 1st at an event, the invitation for that event would go to the 2nd place
finisher. If that player is also already invited, 3rd and 4th place will face off for
the invite.
