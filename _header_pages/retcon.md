## Retcon(structed) Overview

Retcon is an experimental constructed format intended to get people to play with fun,
interesting cards that haven't typically gotten their chance to shine. It asks players
to design their own card pools from which to build their decks. This lets players
play with the best cards from magic's history. And by limiting players' card pools,
Retcon asks players to dig deep into their card pools to find hidden gems to round out
their decks.

It differs from formats like Old School,
Premodern, and Middle School by including cards from recent printings. It differs
from Vintage and Legacy by being far more constrained in card choice, and overall
lower power-level. It differs from Standard, Pioneer, and to a lesser extent Modern
by changing more slowly.

## Deck Construction Rules

1. Choose 1 set from the **Core Sets** pool
1. Choose 1 set from the **Middle School Era** pool
1. Choose 1 set from the **Modern Era** pool
1. Choose 1 set from the **Pioneer Era** pool
