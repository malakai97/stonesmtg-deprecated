This Sunday, 24 players decided to spend their Memorial Day Weekend playing Vintage at 4th Tap! The Texas summer heat reared its ugly head, and by mid-afternoon we were battling in 100-degree heat. Fortunately, we persevered and got ourselves a beautiful Top 4, culminating in Ravager Shops finally taking down a Romancing The Stones event and Aren earning himself an invite to the Festival of Friendship.
