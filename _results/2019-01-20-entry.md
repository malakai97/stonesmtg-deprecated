On Sunday, we hosted the inaugural Festival of Friendship: a non-proxy, charity Old School
tournament celebrating old cards, booze, and, of course, friendship. We weren’t sure how it would
go, as all the Romancing The Stones events have been 100% proxy. However, when the doors of
Barracuda opened at 11:00, we had 28 players ready to sling some power and do shots of Malort.
Everyone’s $20 entry went towards Austin Pets Alive (Austin’s biggest no-kill animal shelter),
and got them breakfast tacos, stickers, and a Sage of Lat Nam. In addition, we were delighted with
a surprise Erhnamgeddon cake courtesy of Mark Brothers!

After our customary 5 rounds of Swiss, our Top 4 was Patrick Vincent, Brian Tweedy, Rob Connolly,
and Winston Wood. They battled it out, and Patrick Vincent and his Trolls emerged victorious to
take home the oversized Chaos Orb!

We were thrilled with the entire event, and can’t thank players enough for making the drive
locally, from San Antonio, and from Houston! After such a successful outing, we’ve decided this
will not be the last you see of the Festival of Friendship . . .
