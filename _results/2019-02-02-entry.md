Yesterday, Romancing The Stones returned to Austin in full force. 27 mages came out to Hopfields to
kick off the 2019 season! After five rounds of swiss, our top 4 was 2018 Champion Bryan Hockey (on
PO), Peter Gustafson (Dredge), Jake Baltz (Grixis Xerox), and new-to-vintage Alex Bosserman (BUG
Oath). Jake gave Hockey a good run for his money in the finals, but ultimately, PO showed its stuff
and Bryan took home the HEB Library.

# Some shoutouts:

* Eric Miller went an impressive 4-1 on Vintage Infect, missing top 4 on breakers!
* First-timers Alex Bosserman, Patrick Merrill, Tom Ronan, and Rick Butkus – thanks for showing
up!
* If Brian Tweedy had showed up, this would have been our largest-ever Vintage event.
