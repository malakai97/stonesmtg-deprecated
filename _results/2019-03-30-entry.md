After the long grind that is living in Austin during SXSW, we’re back! 21 mages made their way
downtown for beer and Vintage. Despite a valiant effort from Merfolk-stalwart Tim Everett,
Patrick Vincent took it down, earning himself a spot in the Invitational and cementing PO as
the deck to beat this season.

# Standings and Lists

This was our first event where we had our consolation prize for players who missed top four
on breakers--[a custom Mental Misstep proxy](/assets/images/misstep.jpg)--only for us to end
up with a clean break thanks to Bryan Hockey's dubious 3-0-2 record.
