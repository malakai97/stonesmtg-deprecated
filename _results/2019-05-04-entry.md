25 players came out to celebrate May the 4th with us at 4th Tap Brewing. After five rounds,
our top 4 looked eerily similar to the last event’s. Joseph Amaya put up a valiant fight with
his Narset PO list, but ultimately couldn’t unseat the Michigan Madman Bryan Hockey, thus
continuing his incredible personal streak and further solidifying PO as the best deck in the
RtS meta.

War of the Spark entered the cardpool this weekend, and our players were eager to try it! Of
25 lists, we saw the following WAR appearances:

* [Narset, Parter of Veils](https://scryfall.com/card/war/61/narset-parter-of-veils):
  8 copies: Narset’s had the most Vintage buzz of all the new WAR cards,
  and put up respectable results. While she was most common in Xerox lists, she was used notably
  by finalist Joseph Amaya in his PO list. Out of 6 rounds, Joseph successfully Timetwistered
  with Narset 4 times!
* [Karn, the Great Creator](https://scryfall.com/card/war/1/karn-the-great-creator):
  9 copies: Karn was our most popular WAR card this weekend, and was used
  in a variety of lists. Top 4 competitor Kai Schafroth included him in his White Eldrazi deck,
  along with a wishboard of cards like Mycosynth Lattice. Elsewhere, Karn was the basis of
  Raf Martinez’s 7th-place Planeswalker Control deck, alongside new Teferi.
* [Saheeli, Sublime Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/war/234/saheeli-sublime-artificer):
  2 copies: Saheeli only showed up in one deck, but it was an
  important one. Bryan Hockey took down the event with his Saheeli PO list, and afterward said she
  was often better than Mentor.
* [Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler):
  4 copies: Teferi showed up exactly where you’d expect him, in controlling
  UWx lists.
* [Bolas’s Citadel](https://scryfall.com/card/war/79/bolass-citadel):
  2 copies: While he didn’t put up great results, Curt Christian had a good time
  playing Bolas’s Citadel in place of Yawgmoth’s Bargain in his DPS list.
* [Blast Zone](https://scryfall.com/card/war/244/blast-zone):
  1 copy: Manny Gonzalez added this to his lands deck. In Manny's own words, "it was something
  that lands needed quite a bit, without having to go into blue. A recurring engineered explosives
  that also taps for mana."
