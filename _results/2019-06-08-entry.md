RTS12 was a momentous occasion for us, as our first ever out-of-town event! 10
brave Austinites road tripped to Houston, where we met 13 locals at PJ’s
Sports Bar to battle and drink very underpriced alcohol. Somehow, Bryan Hockey
took it down again, despite a Top 4 featuring 7 Karn, the Great Creator and 12
Sphere of Resistance. For his efforts, finalist Nick Lee earned himself a spot
at the Invitational.

We really appreciate everyone in Austin who was willing to spend the weekend
making the trip, and the Houstonites who showed us a good time. Our wheels are
turning as we consider more exotic locales where we can bring the Stones...
