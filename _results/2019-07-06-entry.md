title:  "Summer of 94, Part 2 [31 Players]"

---

The Summer of 94 returned this weekend! 31 players came out, making this our
biggest event ever. Kinda Tropical graciously hosted us, setting aside their
entire indoor space for the tournament.

All entries fees went toward Mission 22, which seeks to end veteran suicides.
Combined with our charity card sales, we raised $534.

Our Top 4 was a great cross section of Texas Old School, with Naji Norder
(Austin), Dan Ersch (San Antonio), Simon Christie (Houston), and Danny Friedman
(Dallas) all representing their cities. Likewise, the meta looked healthy, and
there were some awesome cards in the room, including 84 pieces of Power!
