We returned to Growler USA for what was the smallest Romancing the Stones on record.
Still, 12 mages ground out 5 rounds of Vintage, featuring many new pieces of War of
the Spark, Modern Horizons, and London Mulligan tech. The much-feared Dredge took it
down in an impressive 7-0 run by Jack Bellingrath, who earned himself a spot at the
Invitational!
