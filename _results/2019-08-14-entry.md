With a pending B&R announcement and a 3-week lull until our next Vintage event,
we felt like it was a good time to dip our toes into Middle School. 7 mages
came out to try the format, none of whom registered any Blue cards! We met at
our usual Wednesday night testing grounds, Batch Kolaches.

After 3 rounds, Joseph went undefeated by running over everyone with his Elves.

7. Mike O’Malley – [Goblins]({{site.cdn_url}}/assets/images/2019-08-14/7_mike_omalley_goblins.jpg)

Unlike our usual high-stakes events, we ran this tournament for free. Stu
donated a signed Necropotence for 1st Place, and an APAC Forest for Best Brew
(which went to Curt Christian for his Big Red deck).

Now, for some pics:

Some Red on Red action. Ultimately, Mike’s Goblins couldn’t defeat Curt’s
Shard Phoenix, Earthquake, and Wildfires:

Stu’s Weenies got Joseph down to 1 life, before the Elves stabilized with
Masticore and could machine gun down his board:

Curt’s Factories did a good job stonewalling Stu’s 4 pro-Red Knights, but
Armageddon sealed the deal:

Even without Griselbrand in the format, Reanimator is still pretty scary for
Sligh decks:
