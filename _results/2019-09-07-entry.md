The August 26 Restricted List update was a monumental shakeup for Vintage. In
addition to freeing us from the shackles of Karn and Mystic Forge, the DCI also
toned down the Dredge menace. Most importantly, though, the restriction of
Mental Misstep was a huge shift after 8 years of the card’s omnipresence in
blue decks. And that’s to say nothing of the Fastbond unrestriction!

Not surprisingly, our players were reenergized for Vintage! 21 mages joined us
at Lazarus Brewing to enjoy some beer, chilaquiles, 100-degree heat, and a
brand-new Vintage landscape. All that said, nothing ever really changes, and
after 5 rounds and a cut to top 4, Bryan Hockey still took it down on
Paradoxical Outcome.
