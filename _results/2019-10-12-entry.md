Our penultimate event of the season belonged to Bazaar of Baghdad. 16 mages
joined us at Batch to enjoy some kolaches and beer in the Autumn weather.
After 5 rounds of swiss, 2 Survivalists and 1 Necromancer had Bazaar’d their
way into the Top 4.  Ultimately, Jeff’s Vengevines and Hollow Ones took it down,
earning him a spot in this year’s Invitational.
