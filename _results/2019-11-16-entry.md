We finished our 2019 open season at one of the first venues to ever
host an RtS event, Austin Beerworks. 17 mages joined us for a lovely
fall day of Vintage on the patio. Newcomer Ethan Klein put everyone to
shame, Thought-Knotting and Reality Smashing his way through an
undefeated run and earning himself the final spot in this year’s
Invitational!

Thanks again to everyone for an excellent year of Vintage. We’ll see
y’all at the Invitational in December.
