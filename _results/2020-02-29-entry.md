[Announcement](/announce/2020-02-29)

The Stones returned to Austin Beerworks for a sunny, beautiful Leap Day. Of our
22 players, 5 were new to the community and to Vintage!

Tweedy took the day with his trusty Jeskai deck, avenging himself after a loss
in the finals in January and earning a spot in the Invitational. Newcomer Tony
was close behind on Dredge, while Ben and Hockey put up characteristically
strong finishes on two very different Workshop decks.

We’ll be taking a break for SXSW, and can’t wait to see everyone back on
April 11!
