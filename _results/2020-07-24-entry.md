After a successful test run earlier this summer, we returned for a more
ambitious webcam league. 30 players signed up, making this one of our biggest
events to date.

No one was really sure how this league would play out, as many of us were new
to the Middle School format. In the early rounds, it looked like combo decks
stress-testing the format would dominate the league. By the end of round 5,
however, it was clear that interactive control decks still looked good!

This league was a good opportunity for us to dip our toes further intro
streaming. We hosted feature matches every Thursday night on Twitch, and built
a solid viewership. Thanks to producers Rob, Nate, and Tweedy; to guest hosts
Hockey, Andrew, and Stu; to any players who put themselves out there; and to
everyone who tuned in.

On that note, we’d also like to thank everyone who played their matches in
Whereby. We miss each other and playing, so it’s been great getting to watch
matches and see friendly faces again.

Finally, we’d like to give a special shoutout to the non-Texans who joined
the event. A huge benefit of the webcam format is getting to meet and play
against people around the country and world. You guys were excellent additions
to our scene, and we’d love to see you again in our upcoming
[Fall Semester league!](/announce/2020-09-11)
