At 40 players, our Fall Semester Middle School League was handily the biggest
event Romancing The Stones has ever organized. More than anything, we want to
express our gratitude to all 40 players who stuck with us and hung out for 6
rounds of Swiss. On our one-match-a-week schedule, that translates to spending
a month and a half of your lives with us. That’s no small commitment, and we
were thrilled to have all of you.

To the shame (if not surprise) of us all, Lorien Elleman took it down on
Goblins! He may not be a Texan, but he’s a hell of a player.

The Fall Semester drove home to us the diversity and potential of the Middle
School Format. Both the Top 8 and entire field looked quite different than
either of our previous leagues, and the gameplay was great. While we’re
taking a break from leagues as we enter the holiday season, Romancing The
Stones will continue to support Middle School. This format rocks.

We want to give a special shoutout to community stalwart Nate Golia for his
work on running our Twitch stream during the league. Because of the hours he
put in, we were able to host matches on Twitch every Thursday, and had great
viewership. Thanks, Nate, for going above and beyond the call!

You’ll be seeing more Goblin Lackeys, Pernicious Deeds, and Morphlings from
us in 2021. In the meantime, see y’all for some Vintage in 2 weeks!
