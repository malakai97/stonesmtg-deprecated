Our final event of the 2020 was new territory for us. Middle School Leagues
were a good way to familiarize ourselves with the logistics of playing over
webcam. However, while a league runs over 6 weeks, RTS19 was a one-day event!
We weren’t sure how this would go, but the players were great and everything
ran smoothly. 18 players hung out from 11:00 to 7:00 to play their matches,
watch games, and hang out in our discord voice channel. This was as close as
we’ve come during the pandemic to approximating the old feeling of hanging
out, and after the success of this event, we’ll pursue this model further in
2021.

That said, RTS19 was also a return to our bread and butter: Vintage! We
hadn’t played this format since February, so it was great to see our
playerbase hadn’t lost their knack for it.

Bazaar decks looked strong. Dredge-connoisseur Alex Zavoluk decided to take a
different approach than usual, and was rewarded when Hogaak, Vengevine, and
mana sources carried him to victory. Congrats to Alex for a well-played
tournament, and earning himself a spot at the 2020/2021 Invitational
Championship!

With that, we’ll be taking a break for the holidays, and returning strong in
the new year. Keep your eye out for information on the Old School Festival of
Friendship, RTS20, and more Middle School Leagues!
