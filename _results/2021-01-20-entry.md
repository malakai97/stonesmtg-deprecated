After a two-year hiatus, the Festival of Friendship returned!

Our Vintage and Middle School tournaments are cutthroat for-cash competitions,
played for maximum EV. The Festival is not. In the days leading up to the
event, we held a series of charity auctions and raffles benefitting the Central
Texas Food Bank. The TOs assembled a fitting collection of items:

We had no idea what to expect, and set a goal of raising $500. After the
raffles, auction, entry fees, and miscellaneous donations were counted, we
raised $1,150! We cannot thank our community enough for their amazing
generosity.

For the tournament itself, we put together a small prize pool of stamped cards
for the Top 8, and Unlimited Red Blasts for everyone:

The field was noticeably different than [our previous](/results/2018-07-07)
[Old School](/results/2019-01-20) [tournaments](/results/2019-07-06): of 18 players,
only 6 were unpowered! It was a fierce day, taken down by Ty Thomason after an
impressive run on Atog.

We couldn’t be happier with this year’s Festival. Players were incredibly
generous with their wallets and time, and we got to experiment with some new
things as tournament organizers.

And now . . . deck photos!
