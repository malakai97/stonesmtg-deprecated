14 players sat at their computers all day to celebrate our 20th Vintage event!
While turnout was a bit down, competition was fierce: this event featured two
Vintage Champs Top 8 competitors and two 2021 RTS Invitees! But in a tale as
old as time, the whole thing was taken down by Angelo on PO, in his first ever
Vintage event!

We’ll be shifting gears now with back-to-back Middle School leagues. Vintage
will return this spring, but in the meantime, we can’t thank our community
enough for sticking by us through 20 great tournaments. Here’s to the next 20!
