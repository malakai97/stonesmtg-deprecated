We may not have been popular in middle school, but Middle School is popular
with us! The Dance Party broke the record for our biggest league to date, with
46 players from across the US and Canada.

Fall Semester Champion Lorien Elleman defended his title in a dramatic Top 8.
We were thrilled to see a diverse meta that looked very different from our
previous leagues. Middle School continues to look healthy, unexplored, and fun.
