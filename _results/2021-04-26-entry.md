It’s summer and school is out! Last week we wrapped our biggest Middle School League to
date, at 48 players strong.

The league featured great matches every week, and an especially dramatic Top 8. Three
out of four quarterfinalists broke serve and advanced against higher-seeded opponents.
Ultimately, local regular Patrick Vincent made enough land drops and drew enough cards
to bring the title back to Austin.

Going into the summer months, we’ll be taking a break from webcam leagues so we can
enjoy in-person Magic. With that, we’d like to thank several people for their support
over this past year of leagues:

*	Our stream gurus, Nate Golia and Rob Connolly. This is a brutal job. Every week,
  they’re at the mercy of so many different pieces of hardware and software, but they
  habitually put together great entertainment every Thursday night.
*	Woodrow Bogucki, Andrew Webb, and our standing cast of stream hosts. These guys
  stepped up and gave great running commentary throughout weird gameplay, and brought a
  lot of professionalism to our coverage.
*	Rajah James, Jake Hilty, Lorien Elleman, and all of our friends outside of Texas. It’s
  been a true pleasure getting to know all of you guys, and we’d especially like to
  thank the regional community leaders who’ve evangelized both this format our events.

Most importantly, we’d like to express our deep, heartfelt thanks to all the players who
participated in our events over this past year. 2020 and 2021 could easily have cratered
our community, but as things open up, the Romancing the Stones scene is stronger and
more active than ever. Y’all kept us together this year, and we can’t thank you enough.

As recently announced, we have in-person Vintage this Saturday, June 19th at Kinda
Tropical. We’re throwing around ideas for some pop-up events this summer, but otherwise,
y’all can plan on seeing us again this Fall!
