After a year and some change at home, Romancing The Stones is back in person! This past
weekend we returned to our roots with some Vintage at Kinda Tropical. 17 players came
out to celebrate and see each other again.

Modern Horizons 2 was freshly legal and out in force. Our Top 4 featured Urza’s Saga,
Dauthi Voidwalker, Ragavan, and Grief. Longtime competitor Ben Kendrick took it down on
Ravager Shops, earning himself a spot at the 2021 Invitational.

We’ll be taking a break this summer, but will be back in a few months with more Vintage
and Middle School!

Final Standings:

1.	Ben Kendrick – [Ravager Shops](/assets/images/2021-06-19/ben_shops.jpg)

Ben in the semi-finals. We were all having too much fun to snap a proper picture of our
winner with his prize.

Nate hangs on against Ben's Steel Overseer-enhanced team by abusing Lurrus to chump
block. Unable to find his Cindervines to recur, and with no way to wrath the board,
Nate eventually fell to our winner in this exciting finals match.
