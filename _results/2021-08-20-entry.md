We’d hoped to focus on paper tournaments this fall, but the delta variant did its thing
and we had to dial down our ambitions. Turning lemons to lemonade, we put out the call
for another webcam league, and 37 players answered.

The meta was diverse as ever, though Landstill once again rose to the top with 3 of
the Top 8 slots going to the powerful control deck. However, Andrew Webb brewed his
way to victory with a potent combo of Tax/Rack, Psychatog, and Sea Drake.
