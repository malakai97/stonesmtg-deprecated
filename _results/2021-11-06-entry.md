RTS22 capped our 2021 season with a beautiful fall day at Batch. Sun shone through the
trees while grackles chatted above us. 20 players battled over steaming coffee, cold
beer, and fresh kolaches.

After years of resisting it, we finally cut to Top 8 (instead of our traditional Top 4).
A few players dramatically broke serve, and at the end Woodrow took everything down
with his powerful PO deck.

It’s been a great season of events, and we want to thank everyone for their flexibility
and upbeat attitudes through another strange year of organized Magic. 2022 is looking
up, and we’re excited for a great mix of webcam leagues and in-person events like
this one!
