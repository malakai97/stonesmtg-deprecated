New year, new global catastrophes, new Romancing the Stones!

By the numbers, this was our most successful league to date. We had a record 51 players
battling. Despite the headcount, only 2 players dropped early AND we finished every
single round on time – huge shoutout to our players for making that happen! The stream
was also a success: Rob continued to tweak and improve processes, our players and hosts
were great, and we wound up with some pretty polished weekly entertainment.

After recent prominent Control finishes, our players brought a lot of pent-up
aggression to this league. By rough estimation, our top 16 featured 1 control deck,
3 combo decks, 4 aggro-combo decks, and 8 straightup aggro decks! This led to a
dramatic Elf vs Elf finals, with Phil’s Survival Elves taking it down with some help
from Masticore.

In short, the 2022 Dance Party was a mosh pit.
