We immediately followed the Dance Party with the return of the School’s Out Forever
League, and got a solid turnout of 35 players.

We weren’t sure what to expect after last league’s aggro-fest: would aggro run it back,
would combo come out to prey on the fair decks, or would control up its game and take
back over? Well, it turned out to be a little bit of everything! The league was
wonderfully diverse across both the Top 8 and the entire field – exactly what you want
out of Middle School.

Elves took it down again after another strong performance from Mike Klements. Thanks to
the White splash, Mike was able to Geddon the control decks, while still presenting an
impressive clock to the aggro and combo decks. Well done, Mike!

We’ll be taking the next few months off Leagues to focus on in-person Magic and enjoying
Austin’s 100+ heat. Look forward to seeing y’all back later this year for more Middle
School!
