A few years ago, we hosted a Vintage tournament in
[Houston](/results/2019-06-08/).
Ever since, RTS12 has been spoken of as
possibly our most fun, debauched event to date, and we’ve been scheming how to make our
way back to H-Town. Serendipitously, this spring the Falling Stars crew reached out to
us about co-hosting an Old School tournament. After much planning, that turned into the
Hurricane Weekend: a double-header of OS and Vintage in Houston’s Montrose neighborhood.

The Falling Stars did the heavy lifting for Saturday Old School, and boy, did they put
together something fun! 31 players came out to Rudyard’s Pub, good for 7 rounds of swiss
and $1000 raised for the Houston Food Bank. We expect the Stars will be doing a writeup,
so for now, we’ll let some pictures do the talking:

On Sunday we took over for Vintage, and got 23 players back at Rudyard’s – a great
turnout, and a fairly different crowd than Old School. Big Blue and Bazaar strategies
abounded, culminating in a dramatic finals of Austin Hogaak vs Houston PO. Ultimately
Satish took it down off the back of Sphinx of the Steel Wind, representing his hometown
while earning himself a beautiful Tarot Hollow One and a spot at the 2022 Invitational.

Our return to Houston lived up to the hype, and we’d love to make Hurricane Weekend a
permanent fixture on our tournament calendar. In the meantime, we’re finishing out the
2022 season: the Summer School MS League is about to cut to Top 8, after which we’ll be
announcing the Fall Semester MS League in early October, and RTS26 Vintage in November.
