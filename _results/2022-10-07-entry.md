The long summer in Austin has finally ended, bringing back Middle School for its Fall Semester! 33 players registered for 6 weeks of Swiss. Cool dudes and cool decks were all around – especially a certain gold-bordered Grixis Control list that represented 15% of the meta! Thanks, Team Serious.

The Top 8 was a wonderful, diverse mix of archetypes representing combo, control, aggro, and the hybrids of them. All the lists are worth celebrating, but we have to give a special shoutout to our friend from Japan, Masayuki Higashi. Masa’s been playing with us since last year and has Top 8’d a handful of leagues with his powerful Replenish deck. This time, he piloted it to an incredibly convincing 9-0 finish, a perfect record that has made him our first ever international winner (and broke Green’s stranglehold on the season!). Congrats Masa!

The Fall Semester League was our last open event of the season. By the time this post goes live, we’ll have held our annual Invitational here in Austin and crowned the Romancing the Stones Season 4 Champion! More on that soon. It’s been a ball, folks – we appreciate everyone who played with us this season. We’ll take a short break for Chrimbus Season, and will be back with more Middle School and Vintage in January.
