RTS26 was our last open paper event of the season. We met at Tweedy’s, FKA Spider House
Café. Tweedy and his gang have really done their magic rebooting an iconic Austin scene.
The whole vibe was great: it was a lovely fall day with good drinks and a fun group of
mages. So, a great way to send off the season.

The Texas Vintage meta continues to get weirder and weirder. The field was only half
blue, and Bazaars abounded.

Per tradition, we were offering 2 Invitational spots for this event. As a result, the
field was full of thirsty locals who haven’t qualified yet! (Though we also had the
pleasure of some friends from Houston and San Antonio turning out.) Seasons 1 and 2 RTS
champion Bryan Hockey took it down on a wild Caves of Chaos Adventurer/Fable of the
Mirror Breaker Pile, while Tweedy’s 2nd place finish also earned him an Invite.
Congrats, boys!

We’re finishing the last few rounds of the Fall Semester League now, which will cap off
the season and round out our Invitational roster. The Invitational itself is scheduled
for Saturday, December 3rd; we’ll have times, format, venue, and the streaming situation
  announced shortly!

It's been a great season, both digitally and in paper. We hope and expect this year to
have been a template for RTS moving forward, and are already excited for 2023.
