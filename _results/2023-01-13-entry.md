Our third annual Middle School Dance Party has been boogying away for the last
6 weeks! We had a respectable 32 wizards dancing with us this year, including
lots of familiar faces and a few new ones.

By this point, no one should be surprised to see Andrew Webb at the top of the
standings. He’s put up results across many leagues on many different
archetypes. This time, he piloted the fearsome Survival Elves deck to a 7-1
finish, good for first place!

The Top 8 saw a bunch of funny stories play out:
-	Webb played a custom gold-bordered printing of the deck he used to win
the 2021 RTS Invitational. And now, with neither changes to the 75 nor even
sleeves, it’s earned him a spot in the 2023 Invitational!
-	This was Paul Garrett’s very first time playing Middle School, and he
took it all the way to 4th!
-	In the 2022 Dance Party, Stu had an undefeated run on Sligh all the way
to Top 4, when he lost to Survival Elves. In the 2023 Dance Party, Stu had an
undefeated run on Sligh all the way to Top 4, when he again lost to Survival
Elves.
-	This is Jake Hilty’s 4th Top 8, and his 4th loss in the Quarters. The
man just can’t break into the semis.

The league was great, every round ran smoothly, and the meta looks healthy.
This was a perfect way to kick off our year of Middle School. Thanks y’all!
