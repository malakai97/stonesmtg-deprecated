We kicked off our Vintage season with a cozy 12-man event at Conan’s Pizza.
It’s been
cool and rainy in Austin, so a day of beer, pizza, and cards was perfect.

Our local Goblins aficionado Robin Mannas took it down. Robin’s been knocking
on the
door of a win after many, many Top 8s, and finally he Snooped his way to
victory.
Welcome to the 2023 Invitational, Robin.

With this event, we got to debut this season’s trophies: 90s-style baseball
Planeswalkers! Our proxy guru Bobby has crushed it again, and we’ve got a
hell of a
lineup of trophies to hand out.
