It’s been a busy Q1 for our community: from RTS27 to the Dance Party League
to the Hunter Burton Memorial in Dallas, we’ve had our share of Magic to play in Texas!
To finish out the quarter, we held RTS28 this past weekend at Kinda Tropical. It was a
beautiful, sunny day, and 14 wizards came out to play Vintage.

How many times have I written the following sentence? “Bryan Hockey won the
tournament on a spicy blue pile.” The man is hard to stop, and added our wonderful
Teferi Baseball Card to his growing collection of RTS Trophies. Because Hockey’s already
qualified for the Invitational, runner-up Patrick Vincent came away with an Invite for
his efforts.
