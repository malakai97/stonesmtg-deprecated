For the last event of Romancing the Stones’s twenties we met at our old
standby, Batch Kolaches. It was a lovely May day in the high 70s, and we got 18
players – a nice uptick after two smaller events earlier this year. Good for
5 rounds of Vintage and a cut to Top 8!

Paul Garrett came onto our scene in 2022 and pretty quickly established himself
as a strong competitor: this season he’s already Top 8’d both RTS27 and the
Dance Party. It wasn’t a huge surprise, then, that he Breached his way to
victory. Welcome to the Invitational, Paul, and enjoy the Jace Trophy!

We’ll be taking a Vintage hiatus for June – expect us back sometime in
July. In the meantime, we’ll have more Middle School shortly – watch this
space!
