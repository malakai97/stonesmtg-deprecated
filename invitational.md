Romancing the Stones tournament series are divided into seasons. Each season lasts about
a year, and ends with the Romancing the Stones Invitational for that season.

# Invites

A total of 10 invitations will be given out for season 2. They are:

* A total of 8 invitations for the winners of the 8 qualifying events held throughout the year
* 1 invite to the uninvited player with the most top 4 appearances
* 1 invite to last season's invitational champion, [Bryan Hockey](/assets/images/2019-02-02/2.jpg)

Players can never earn more than one invitation. Thus, if a player who is already invited places
1st at an event, the invitation for that event would go to the 2nd place finisher. If that player
is also already invited, 3rd and 4th place will face off for the invite.
